# Concept Reference

These C++20 concepts are defined in the `FredEmmott::weak_refs::weak_refs_concepts` namespace, which is inlined into the `FredEmmott::weak_refs` namespace. This means that they are available with either:

```c++
// Pull in the whole library, including the concepts...
use namespace FredEmmott::weak_refs;
// ... or just the concepts
use namespace FredEmmott::weak_refs::weak_refs_concepts;
```
