# `FredEmmott::cppwinrt`

A support library for [C++/WinRT](https://github.com/microsoft/cppwinrt).

This library is primarily intended for use as an implementation detail of [`FredEmmott::bindline`](../bindline/index.md) and [`FredEmmott::weak_refs`](../weak_refs/index.md), but it also contains functions and C++20 concepts that can be useful without the other two libraries; for example, concepts are included for `winrt_implementation`, `winrt_interface`, `winrt_com_ptr`.

For details, see [the API reference](reference/index.md).
